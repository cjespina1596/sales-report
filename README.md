This visualization came about from some sort contest in a Facebook group that gave free access to Data Analysis lessons to the top 5 visualizations they can pick. I decided to give it a go, even though I never saw any chance of winning. I've only made one complete viz at this point, after all. I need all the experience I can get. The dataset is about sales from a (generated) company and they needed to answer the following questions: (1) In what month did we get the highest profits? (2) In what country did we get the most profit? and (3) What product and segment gave us the most profit?

There was only 24 hours remaining when I learned about the Facebook post, so I had to move fast. In the end, I finished the viz in about 5 hours. It was a nice experience, I would say.
